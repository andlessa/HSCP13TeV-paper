#Smodels hover information. Options are:
#SModelS hover information. 
#Options are:
#SmodelS_excluded -> Prints whether the point is excluded or not by SModelS
#r_max -> Shows the highest r-value for each parameter point
#chi2 -> Shows the chi^2 value,if available (if not the output is -.1).
#Tx -> Shows the topologies which give r_max
#Analysis -> Shows the experimental analysis from which the strongest constraint (r_max) comes from
#MT_max -> Shows the missing topology with the largest cross section (in SModelS bracket notation)
#MT_max_xsec -> Shows the cross section of MT_max
#MT_total_mxsec -> Shows the total missing cross section (i.e. the sum of all missing topologies cross sections)  
#MT_long_xsec -> Shows the total missing cross section in long cascade decays  
#MT_asym_xsec -> Shows the total missing cross section in decays with asymmetric branches 
#MT_outgrid_xsec -> Shows the total missing cross section where we are outside the mass grid 
#file -> Shows the name of the input spectrum file
